The `crypto` chapter is out, and if you thought the container chapter was big, you've got another thing coming.

This bad boy pushes the book size up to 100 pages, and on top of the **14** regular examples, there is **15th** example that shows how a *timing attack* works.

### Here's the kicker...

I can't keep selling this {{ site.go.pages }} page book with {{ site.go.chapters }} out of {{ site.go.total_chapaters }} chapters for only $29, so I had to bump the price up to **${{ site.go.price }}**.

Madness!

If you don't think this book is worth your **${{ site.go.price }}**, grab the [Sample PDF]({{ site.go.sample }}) and check out a couple chapters.

Obviously I encourage you to pick it up, and learn how to use the crypto by [getting Go, The Standard Library](/go.html) for only ${{ site.go.price }}. Odds are, that price will go up in the future even a bit more, so get your hands on a copy now before it does!
