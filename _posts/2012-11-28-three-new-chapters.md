Three new chapters dude! Excellent!

Okay so I finally got some more content out, the **debug**, **encoding**, and **errors** chapters. The last one is really short, but the other two are pretty huge.

### Need a copy?

Look no further than [this page](/go.html). For only **${{ site.go.price }}** you can get all {{ site.go.chapters }} chapters and {{ site.go.pages }} of [Go, The Standard Library](/go.html). Purchases help keep me motivated :)

Leanpub will lovingly assemble bytes into **PDF**, **MOBI**, and **EPUB** formats, for easy reading anywhere.

If you're not ready yet, maybe you're waiting for more, there's still a [Sample PDF]({{ site.go.sample }}) to grab with a couple chapters. Give it a look, and if you dig it, pick up a copy, and get free updates for life.
