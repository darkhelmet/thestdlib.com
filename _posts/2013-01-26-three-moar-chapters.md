It's been a while, I just can't seem to find a good flow for writing, but there are three new chapters out.

The **expvar**, **flag** and **fmt** chatpers are squared away and ready for your viewing. They're all solid packages with 9 examples spanning the 3 chapters. Every Go developer should be familiar with these packages, and the best way to do that is [pick up a copy]({{ site.go.leanpub }}).

### Need a copy?

Check out [this page](/go.html). A measely **${{ site.go.price }}** gets you all {{ site.go.chapters }} chapters and {{ site.go.pages }} pages of [Go, The Standard Library](/go.html).

Leanpub will lovingly assemble your book into **PDF**, **MOBI**, and **EPUB** formats, for easy reading anywhere. With **No DRM**.

If you're not ready yet, maybe you're waiting for more, there's still a [Sample PDF]({{ site.go.sample }}) to grab with a couple chapters. Give it a look, and if you dig it, pick up a copy, and get free updates for life.

I even updated the sample with an extra chapter from this update!
