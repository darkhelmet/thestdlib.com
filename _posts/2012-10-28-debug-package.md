The `debug` package lets you poke around various file formats and see what's inside. Formats like Mach-O, ELF, Windows PE, and Go specific files created by the gc family of compilers.

And I've finally wrapped up the debug chapter. It's good to go.

### Can I get in on this?

Oh yes you sure can. [Follow me](/go.html) and give the product page a once over. Convinced? Sure you are. Follow the [Buy Now](https://leanpub.com/go-thestdlib) and pick up your copy of [Go, The Standard Library](/go.html) for only **${{ site.go.price }}**. I'll :heart: you forever.

You'll get {{ site.go.chapters }}, washed, soaked, and rinsed, fresh from the Leanpub servers, in all your favorite formats: **PDF**, **MOBI**, and **EPUB**.

Wallet telling you no? I can understand. ${{ site.go.price }} isn't $1 app on the app store, but this book gives you so much more, and will keep on giving (did I mention, there's free updates for life?). [Download the free Sample PDF]({{ site.go.sample }}) and see what you think. If you like what you see, I'd appreciate the support.
