The `database` chapter is wrapped up to a point where I can publish it. It's a pretty straightforward package, and right now I cover using it as you'd expect. I'll get an example of writing a driver for it later.

This new chapter adds another 10 pages to the book, and of course the updated code can be downloaded from Github using the links in Introduction.

### But I want to read it!!!

Well, dear sir or madam, head over [here](/go.html) and pick up your copy of [Go, The Standard Library](/go.html) for only **${{ site.go.price }}**. I'd really appreciate it.

You'll get this brand new chapter, hot off the Leanpub presses, in **PDF**, **MOBI**, and **EPUB** formats, to top off {{ site.go.chapters }} complete chapters full of Go goodness.

If you're not ready to open up your wallet just yet, grab the [Sample PDF]({{ site.go.sample }}) and check out a couple chapters. Give it a look, and if you dig it, pick up a copy, and get free updates for life.
