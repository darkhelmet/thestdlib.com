I think this chapter is my favorite so far. Not too many languages have a usable library to parse and examine the source code of the language itself. Or if they do, they aren't as well designed as the `go` package.

The new chapter has 5 great examples, with some great real world use cases. You might not use them every day, but they can definitely improve your understanding of the language and might just come in handy. I'll be turning one of the examples into a blog post, but if you want the whole things you'll need to [pick up a copy]({{ site.go.leanpub }}).

### Need a copy?

Head over [here](/go.html). A mere **${{ site.go.price }}** gets you all {{ site.go.chapters }} chapters and {{ site.go.pages }} pages of [Go, The Standard Library](/go.html).

Leanpub will hand craft your book into **PDF**, **MOBI**, and **EPUB** formats, for reading on all your devices. With **No DRM**.

If you're not ready yet, maybe you're waiting for more, there's still a [Sample PDF]({{ site.go.sample }}) to grab with a couple chapters. Give it a look. If it's your thing, pick up a full copy, and get free updates for life.
