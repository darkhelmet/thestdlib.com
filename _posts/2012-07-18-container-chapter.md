The `container` chapter is out, and it's a big one.

I'm not kidding. Each of `heap`, `list`, and `ring` has their own example, along with a more real world example. It starts on page 52 and ends on 65.

While the Go language has slices and maps built in, sometimes you need some specific structure to solve a problem. The container package has got you covered for a few of those structures.

Learn how best to use this package by [getting Go, The Standard Library](/go.html) for only **${{ site.go.price }}**. That price will definitely be going up in the future so get your hands on a copy now before it does!
