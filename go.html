            <h2>About The Book</h2>
            <p>Some smart people working at Google came out with a language called <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, and it's got a wicked awesome standard library. The problem is, the standard library of any language plays second fiddle to the syntax and other libraries that come out on Github</p>
            <p>With <i>Go, The Standard Library</i>, I give you the tools to take Go by the horns and be productive without installing every library on Github.</p>

            <h2>Only <b>$29</b>? Surely you can't be serious</h2>
            <p><b>I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.</b> Get it now before I change my mind! It's going to be an in depth look at the library of packages that come standard with you Go distribution, and it's a big library.</p>
            <p><b>Shit son, what if I don't want to hand over my hard earned $29?</b></p>
            <p>If you're not quite ready to part with 29 clams just yet, the <b>entire first chapter</b> is available as a <b>free sample</b>. You can also check out the table of contents outline too, which isn't even close to done yet and we're already up to <b>42</b> pages! I mean, you're already at less than a dollar a page.</p>
            <p>I'm no mathemagician, but that's a pretty solid deal to me.</p>
            <p>When the book is basically complete, I might even get crazy and raise that price a bit. Buy now, and lock in your $29, and get <b>free updates forever!</b></p>
