            <h2>About The Book</h2>
            <p>Some smart people working at Google came out with a language called <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, and it's got a wicked awesome standard library. The problem is, the standard library of any language plays second fiddle to the syntax and other libraries that come out on Github</p>
            <p>With <i>{{ page.title }}</i>, I give you the tools to take Go by the horns and be productive without installing every library on Github.</p>

            <h2>Only <b>${{ page.price }}</b>? Surely you can't be serious</h2>
            <p><b>I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.</b> Get it now before I change my mind! It's going to be an in depth look at the library of packages that come standard with you Go distribution, and it's a big library.</p>
            <p><b>Great grandmother's memory allocator! What if I don't want to hand over my hard earned ${{ page.price }}?</b></p>
            <p>If you're not quite ready to part with {{ page.price }} clams just yet, <b>two full chapters</b> are available as a <b><a href="http://samples.leanpub.com/go-thestdlib-sample.pdf">{{ page.title }} free sample</a></b>. You can also check out the <a href="http://leanpub.com/go-thestdlib">table of contents outline</a> too, which isn't even close to done yet and we're already up to <b>{{ page.pages }}</b> pages! I mean, you're already at way less than a dollar a page.</p>
            <p>I'm no mathemagician, but that's a pretty solid deal to me.</p>
            <p>When the book is basically complete, I might even get crazy and raise that price a bit. <a href="http://leanpub.com/go-thestdlib">Buy Now</a>, and lock in your ${{ page.price }}, and get <b>free updates forever!</b></p>
