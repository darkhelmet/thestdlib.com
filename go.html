            <h2>About The Book</h2>
            <p>Some smart people working at Google came out with a language called <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, and it's got a wicked awesome standard library. The problem is, the standard library of anything language plays second fiddle to the syntax and other libraries and come out on Github</p>
            <p>With <i>Go, The Standard Library</i>, I give you the tools to take Go by the horns and be productive without installing every library on Github.</p>
