        <h2>What's all this then?</h2>
        <p>I saw a gap in the programming world. Most languages have an extensive standard library and core that a lot of programmers are missing out on. I was doing things the long way because I just didn't know the standard library had something built in.</p>
        <p>I'm trying to fill that gap with deep looks at the standard library of your favorite language. My first step is <b><a href="/go.html">Go</a></b>, the new programming language from Google. If it takes off, I'll look at other languages like Ruby, Python, Javascript, and C.</p>
        <h2>Another mailing list?</h2>
        <p>I'm in the progress of writing the first chapter and will get that out as a free sample, and start publishing the book on Leanpub then, making it available for sale.</p>
        <p>After that, I just need to keep up a good pace to get new chapters out and revise existing chapters.</p>
        <p>If you <a href="#">sign up</a>, I'll be able to keep you up to date on new versions of the book and free material.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <h2>Anything else right now?</h2>
        <p>I'm going to give Leanpub a go for building the first book, so it'll be available as <b>PDF</b>, <b>ePub</b>, and <b>Mobi</b>, for reading on pretty much everything. I even hear the PDF can be fed to Lulu to make a pretty mean hardcopy.</p>
        <h2>Twitter</h2>
        <p>You might also consider following <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStdLib">@TheStdLib</a> on Twitter for those updates that just don't make sense for a full email blast.</p>
