        <h2>What's all this then?</h2>
        <p>I saw a gap in the programming world. Most languages have an extensive standard library and core that a lot of programmers are missing out on. I was doing things the long way because I just didn't know the standard library had something built in.</p>
        <p>I'm trying to fill that gap with deep looks at the standard library of your favorite language. My first step is <b>Go</b>, the new programming language from Google. If it takes off, I'll look at other languages like Ruby, Python, Javascript, and C.</p>

    <div class="span4">
        <h2>Why just an email signup?</h2>
        <p>See, the thing is, there is no book yet.</p>
        <p>Oh sure, I've got the project setup on Leanpub, and it's all ready to go. I figured I'd better actually see what kind of interest there is first.</p>
        <p>After that, I'll work out some basic things, write a couple chapters, and see what people think.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <h2>Anything else right now?</h2>
        <p>I'm going to give Leanpub a go for building the first book, so it'll be available as <b>PDF</b>, <b>ePub</b>, and <b>Mobi</b>, for reading on pretty much everything. I even hear the PDF can be fed to Lulu to make a pretty mean hardcopy.</p>
