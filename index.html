        <h2>What's all this then?</h2>
        <p>I saw a gap in the programming world. Most languages have an extensive standard library and core that a lot of programmers are missing out on. I was doing things the long way because I just didn't know the standard library had something built in.</p>
        <p>I'm trying to fill that gap with deep looks at the standard library of your favorite language. My first step is Go, the new programming language from Google. If it takes off, I'll look at other languages like Ruby, Python, Javascript, and C.</p>

        <h2>Why just an email signup?</h2>
        <p>See, the thing is, there is no book yet.</p>
        <p>Oh sure, I've got the project setup on Leanpub, and it's all ready to go. I figured I'd better actually see what kind of interest there is first.</p>
        <p>After that, I'll work out some basic things, write a couple chapters, and see what people think.</p>
